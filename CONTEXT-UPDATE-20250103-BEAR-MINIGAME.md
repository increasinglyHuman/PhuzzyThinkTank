# Context Update: Bear Runner Mini-Game Implementation
**Date:** January 3, 2025
**Session Focus:** Timeline Visualization Enhancements & Hidden Mini-Game

## Overview
Enhanced the timeline prototype with smooth curves, interactive features, and a hidden "Runner Bear" mini-game that transforms data visualization into an engaging educational experience.

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. Timeline Visualization Improvements
- **Smooth Bezier curves** replacing jagged line segments
- **Interactive dimension toggles** with tri-state behavior (off/on/highlight)
- **Text highlighting** that correlates with chart elements
- **Visual timer bars** with rainbow gradient (green→yellow→red)
- **Smaller, cleaner labels** for better readability

### 2. Runner Bear Mini-Game System

#### Discovery Mechanism
- **Bear paw icons** in upper right of each timeline (27x27px, rotated -15°)
- Custom SVG paw print design (white on orange gradient background)
- 10-minute cooldown between plays
- Clicking paw → randomly selects one dimension → starts game

#### Game Mechanics
- **20-second timer** with visual rainbow bar
- **No push cooldowns** - rapid clicking enabled
- **Rolling ball physics** with proper slope adherence
- **Victory condition**: Bear reaches >95% position
- **Reward**: +5 RIZ points (ready for main game integration)

#### Visual Features
- **Custom colored balls** replacing emojis:
  - Blue ball (logic)
  - Pink ball (emotion, replacing heart)
  - Green ball (balanced)
  - Orange ball (agenda)
- **Rolling animation** - balls rotate as they move
- **Spark effects** on each push button click
- **DOOM-style countdown** for final 5 seconds:
  - Dark grey text with intense red glow
  - Impact font, growing size
  - Full-screen overlay at z-index 10000

### 3. Physics Implementation
- **Catmull-Rom spline interpolation** for smooth curve following
- **Ground normal calculations** preventing floating/sinking
- **Gravity and momentum** affecting uphill/downhill movement
- **Character states**: rolling, struggling (uphill), zooming (downhill)
- **Velocity boost system** from push button (0.006 units)

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Perception Gap
- Initial animations too fast (like old Asteroids on modern PCs)
- Solution: Reduced physics constants by 10x, lowered to 10 FPS

### 2. Screen Flicker
- Competing DOM updates causing Windows display issues
- Solution: RequestAnimationFrame batching, reduced highlight padding

### 3. Z-Index Issues
- Countdown text hidden behind glow effects
- Solution: Increased z-index to 10000, dark text with red glow backdrop

### 4. Completion Detection
- Bear reaching cave not triggering victory
- Solution: Added per-second checks in main game loop

## Key Code Sections

### Bear Game State
```javascript
let bearGameState = {
    lastPlayTime: 0,
    cooldownMinutes: 10,
    activeTimer: null,
    timeLeft: 20,
    gameActive: false,
    urgentMode: false
};
```

### Character Movement (Ball Rolling)
```javascript
// In drawCharacter()
const rollRotation = (this.characterData.position || 0) * Math.PI * 8;
this.ctx.save();
this.ctx.rotate(rollRotation);
// Draw rotating highlights
this.ctx.restore();
```

### Victory Detection
```javascript
// In game timer loop
[timeline1, timeline2].forEach((chart) => {
    if (chart.characterData && chart.characterData.position > 0.95) {
        endGame(true);
        return;
    }
});
```

## Current Status
- Mini-game fully functional with all requested features
- Ready for RIZ points integration with main game
- 10-minute cooldown prevents spam
- Educational value: Kids learn how different argument dimensions create different "terrain"

## Next Steps for Integration
1. Connect RIZ points system from main game
2. Add achievement tracking for mini-game victories
3. Consider difficulty levels (different time limits/boost amounts)
4. Potentially add more mini-games to other visualizations

## Design Decisions
- **No push delay bar**: Removed for cleaner UI and faster gameplay
- **Rolling balls instead of paw imprints**: Better visual feedback
- **Dark countdown text**: Solves readability over red glow
- **20-second timer**: Balanced challenge without frustration

## Known Issues
- None currently - all reported issues resolved

## User Experience Flow
1. User explores timeline → clicks dimension buttons
2. Discovers bear paw icon (quirky -15° rotation catches eye)
3. Click paw → game starts with random dimension
4. Rapid clicking to push bear up hills
5. Visual/audio feedback throughout
6. DOOM countdown creates urgency
7. Victory celebration or encouragement to retry

This mini-game successfully transforms data visualization into an engaging educational tool that reinforces learning about argument manipulation tactics through play.
