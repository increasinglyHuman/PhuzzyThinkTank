  "text": "From TheTimelineInquisition.net - 'PROOF The MCU Timeline is PROPAGANDA':\n\nListen up, sheeple! I've spent 4,000 hours creating the DEFINITIVE timeline that Marvel doesn't want you to see!\n\nTHEY CLAIM: Spider-Man Homecoming is 8 years after Avengers\nTHE TRUTH: It's clearly 6 years! The hot dog vendor's wedding ring proves it!\n\nI've analyzed:\n- Every calendar visible in backgrounds (enhanced 400x)\n- Moon phases in night scenes\n- Character aging via pore analysis\n- Smartphone models to pinpoint exact months\n- Tree foliage patterns indicating seasons\n\nMY DISCOVERIES:\n1. Tony's arc reactor runs on LIES\n2. The 'Blip' was actually 5.2 years (I counted days)\n3. Peter Parker's field trip permission slip DESTROYS official chronology\n\nMarvelShill_42: 'Dude, it's just a movie continuity error'\n\nMe: WAKE UP! 'Continuity errors' are DELIBERATE TIMELINE MANIPULATION! Why else would Happy's beard grow 2.3mm between scenes that are supposedly the same day?!\n\nI've sent 847 emails to Kevin Feige. His restraining order proves I'm onto something!\n\nMy wife left me, says I need to 'stop measuring fictional time.' She's clearly been compromised by Disney's Temporal Division.\n\nJOIN MY PATREON for access to:\n- My 3,000 page Timeline Bible\n- Facial hair growth charts for all characters\n- classified moon phase calculations\n- The REAL reason Phase 4 exists (timeline coverup)\n\nThey called me crazy when I quit my job to solve this. But someone has to protect timeline integrity!\n\n*Currently cross-referencing sunset times with canonical Stark Industries work schedules*\n\n#TimelineTruth #ChronologyGate #TemporalJustice #NotMyTimeline",
