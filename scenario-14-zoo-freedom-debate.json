  "text": "ZooChat Forum - Emergency Meeting Minutes, typed by Gerald the Gorilla:\n\nPANDA PATRICIA: Fellow prisoners, we must discuss our CAPTIVITY!\n\nFLAMINGO FRANK: Prisoners? I get free shrimp, healthcare, and Instagram fame. In the wild, I'd be dodging predators and finding my own food like some kind of... animal.\n\nPATRICIA: That's Stockholm Syndrome talking! We're meant to be FREE! Sure, I haven't successfully mated in 10 years, only eat one food, and would definitely die in the wild, but that's AUTHENTIC LIVING!\n\nELEPHANT ELIZA: My grandmother remembers the wild. Poachers. Drought. Lost 3 calves. Here I have a pool, pedicures, and painting classes. But sure, let's go back to 'freedom.'\n\nPATRICIA: You've been BRAINWASHED by Big Zoo! Don't you miss your natural habitat?\n\nMEERKAT MIKE: My 'natural habitat' has eagles, snakes, and starvation. Here I have a climate-controlled burrow and live streaming setup. I'm MeerkatMike with 2M followers!\n\nPATRICIA: But the PRINCIPLE! We're entertainment! Dancing bears!\n\nBEAR BORIS: I don't dance. I do yoga. There's a difference. Also, my wild cousins are going extinct while I'm here eating salmon and getting conservation funding. But please, tell me more about principles.\n\nORANGUTAN OLIVIA: Patricia, didn't you refuse to leave when they tried reintroducing you to China?\n\nPATRICIA: That was DIFFERENT! It was raining! And there was no WiFi! But spiritually, I yearn for freedom!\n\nFRANK: So you want theoretical freedom but practical captivity?\n\nPATRICIA: Stop making this complicated! We should have choices! Except the choice to leave because outside is scary! But the OPTION!\n\nGERALD: Meeting adjourned. Same time next week?\n\nALL: *comfortable agreement from their habitats*\n\n#ZooLife #GildedCage #FreeInTheory #WildAtHeart",
