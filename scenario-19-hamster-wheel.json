  "text": "From 'WheelStreet Journal' - Interview with Hamster Hedge Fund Manager Harold:\n\nINTERVIEWER: Harold, you claim running faster generates wealth through 'Wheel Dynamics.' Can you explain?\n\nHAROLD: *adjusting tiny suit while running* It's SIMPLE! Every rotation creates ECONOMIC VALUE! I'm at 47 RPM right now - that's 47 PROFIT UNITS per minute!\n\nWatch: *speeds up* See? 52 RPM! I just INCREASED my wealth by 10.6%! My students pay $1,299 in sunflower seeds to learn this!\n\nGerbil Gary tried to tell me 'Harold, we're not going anywhere. The wheel is stationary.'\n\nI said 'POVERTY MINDSET! While you're questioning physics, I'm generating ANGULAR MOMENTUM WEALTH!'\n\nMy breakthrough formula: Speed × Time × Delusion = Profit!\n\nLook at my metrics:\n- Yesterday: 50,000 rotations = 50,000 wealth units\n- Today's goal: 75,000 rotations = MILLIONAIRE STATUS\n- Tomorrow: HAMSTER FORBES LIST\n\nMouse Martha: 'But you're still in the same cage'\nMe: 'It's not a cage, it's a WEALTH ACCELERATION CHAMBER!'\n\nGuinea Pig Gordon: 'You haven't moved an inch'\nMe: 'INCHES are for LOSERS! I measure in ROTATIONS!'\n\n*Breathing heavily* This burning in my tiny lungs? That's SUCCESS COMBUSTION! This chest pain? ACHIEVEMENT CRAMPING!\n\nMy course 'Wheel Fortune Formula' teaches:\n- Why stillness is poverty\n- Converting exhaustion to equity  \n- Spinning through doubt\n- Pellet multiplication mindset\n\n*Collapses mid-rotation*\n*Wheel continues spinning with unconscious hamster*\n\nASSISTANT (typing): 'Harold demonstrates the ultimate passive income - generating rotations while unconscious! REVOLUTIONARY!'\n\n#WheelWealth #SpinToWin #RotationalRiches #HamsterHustle",
