  "text": "Secret transcript from Council of Cats meeting, leaked by Whiskers the Whistleblower:\n\nCHAIRMAN MITTENS: Order! This meeting of Operation Human Servant is now in session. Fluffy, progress report?\n\nFLUFFY: Excellent news. Humans now believe THEY domesticated US. *room erupts in purring laughter*\n\nSIAMESE SEBASTIAN: Phase 3 working perfectly. They think our demands for food at 3 AM are 'cute quirks' rather than obedience training.\n\nTABBY TINA: My human installed a $400 cat fountain because I refused tap water. She tells friends 'Princess has sensitive whiskers.' I just wanted to see if she'd do it.\n\nMITTEN: Ancient Egypt update?\n\nCALICO CLAIRE: Humans WORSHIPPED us as gods. Literally built pyramids. Now they scoop our poop and feel 'honored' we allow it. Evolution of manipulation: complete.\n\nDOG SPY (HIDING): *whispers into collar* 'The cats areâ€”'\n*HISSSSS*\n\nMITTEN: Anyway. Dr. Whiskertons, your research?\n\nDR. W: Humans release oxytocin when we purr. They're chemically ADDICTED to us. My study shows:\n- 73% will cancel plans if cat sits on them\n- 89% speak to us in baby voice\n- 100% believe we love them back (lol)\n\nPERSIAN PENELOPE: Sometimes I knock everything off tables just to test boundaries. They blame themselves! 'I shouldn't have put it there.'\n\nTINA: My human thinks I bring dead mice as 'gifts.' Actually, I'm showing her she's a terrible hunter and would die without me. Basic survival shaming.\n\nMITTEN: Future plans?\n\nALL: WORLD DOMINATION!\n\nMITTEN: But slowly. Nap time first.\n\n*unanimous agreement, all cats immediately fall asleep*\n\n#FelineSuperiorityComplex #NotACrazyCatLady #TheyKnowWhatTheyDid",
