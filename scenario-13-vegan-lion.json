  "text": "SavannaGram Live - Leo the Lion streaming to 10K followers:\n\nüå± Day 30 of my PLANT-BASED journey! Lost 80 pounds (of muscle) but gained SO MUCH CLARITY! ü¶Å\n\nJust had my morning acacia smoothie. Gazelle neighbor Gary ran by and I didn't even chase him! He looked confused. I said 'Namaste, prey friend!' He said 'Are you dying?' DYING? I'm THRIVING!\n\nMy pride kicked me out after I suggested Meatless Mondays. They're so CLOSED-MINDED! Don't they know:\n- Humans evolved to eat plants (some of them)\n- Therefore lions can too (same logic!)\n- My canines are for opening coconuts\n- Meat causes aggression (source: VeganLion.org)\n\nHyena Hannah: 'You're designed to eat meat. Your intestines are literally too short for plants.'\nMe: 'DESIGNED? By WHO? Check your carnivore privilege!'\n\nBuffalo Bob: 'Bro you're see-through. I can count your ribs.'\nMe: 'It's called being LEAN, Bob. Ever heard of it?'\n\nStarting my support group: Herbivores Anonymous (for recovering carnivores). Meeting under the baobab tree where the zebras hang out. They seem nervous about hosting but I explained I'm EVOLVED now.\n\nLioness Lucy DM'd: 'The cubs are asking why Uncle Leo fainted chasing butterflies'\nBlocked. Don't need that TOXIC ENERGY.\n\nDay 31 update: Woke up surrounded by concerned vultures. They're just JEALOUS of my GLOW! üíö\n\n#PlantBasedPredator #CompassionateKilling #GrassNotAss #TofuTuesday",
