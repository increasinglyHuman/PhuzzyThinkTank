Some 'negative' bees have been reporting 'problems' - let's reframe:\n\n‚ùå 'We're working ourselves to death' \n‚úÖ 'We're living our PURPOSE!'\n\n‚ùå 'Winter killed 40% of us'\n‚úÖ '60% THRIVED through adversity!'\n\n‚ùå 'The Queen lays 2000 eggs daily while we do all the work'\n‚úÖ 'We're BLESSED with leadership!'\n\nWorker Wendy raised concerns about 16-hour shifts. I said 'Wendy, are you a CAN-bee or a CAN'T-bee?' She's now on probation for 'toxic negativity.'\n\nDrone David mentioned he'll die after mating. I reminded him that's his PRIVILEGE! Not everyone gets to fulfill their destiny! He should be GRATEFUL! #Blessed\n\nNEW HIVE POLICIES:\n- Complaining about pesticides = BANNED (attracts more pesticides with negative energy!)\n- Pointing out colony collapse = FEAR MONGERING\n- Asking for breaks = LAZY BEE ENERGY\n- Dying of exhaustion = CHOOSING to not bee positive enough!\n\nRemember: Other hives have REAL problems. We just have OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH! \n\nForager Frances: 'But literally half the flowers are gone due to habitat loss'\nMe: 'Frances, you're not MANIFESTING hard enough! Visualize abundance!'\n\nBeekeeper just smoked us out and stole our honey AGAIN. But hey, at least we're not wasps, right?! PERSPECTIVE! üçØ\n\nAnyone caught frowning will attend my workshop: 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Bees' (mandatory, unpaid, during your sleep cycle).\n\nBuzz responsibly! üêùüíõ\n#HiveLife #PositiviBee #GoodVibesOnly #ToxicColony",
