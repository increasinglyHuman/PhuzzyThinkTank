FACTS:\n- Shields that work in space (not just planets)\n- Teleporters (board and disable)\n- Photon torpedoes (way stronger than lasers)\n- Better captain speeches\n\nu/SithLord1977: LMAOOO your 'facts' are hilarious\n- Death Star one-shots planets\n- Force users predict everything\n- AT-ATs would crush redshirts\n- Empire has better theme music (John Williams > random beeps)\n\nu/PhotonPurist: I ran 47,000 simulations in my custom physics engine (I'm an actual physicist btw). Trek wins 98.3% of scenarios. My peer-reviewed paper: www.totallyreal.edu/trekwins\n\nu/WormholeExpert: Actually *adjusts glasses* if we calculate the energy output based on stated canon...\n*Posts 5,000 word essay with equations*\n*Nobody reads it*\n\nu/CasualFan2020: hey what if they just became friends and fought the borg together :)\n↳ [-2,847 points] 'GET OUT CASUAL'\n\nu/SithLord1977: Your 'physicist' claim is BS. I checked - you teach high school chemistry\n\nu/PhotonPurist: AD HOMINEM ATTACK! Classic Wars fan move!\n\nu/BattlestarBro: *Eating popcorn* Meanwhile BSG would wreck both lol\n↳ [Thread derails into 3-way war]\n\nMOD MESSAGE: Locked. Again. Y'all took 'Star Wars' too literally. Touch grass. Watch other shows. Please.\n\nu/PhotonPurist: [FINAL POST] Starting new sub: r/TrekSupremacy. Wars fans will be banned on sight using my algorithm that detects midichlorian sympathizers\n\n#TrekVsWars #CanonFights #SpaceSupremacy #NerdRage",
