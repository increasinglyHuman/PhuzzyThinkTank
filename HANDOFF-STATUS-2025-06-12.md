## 🎯 Current Status: JSON Object Verification Phase

### ✅ **Recently Completed Major Work:**
1. **Timeline Visualization Complete Rewrite** - Direct keyword positioning with dots + splines
2. **Thermodynamic Cooling Theory** - Splines cool toward neutral (50) between keywords  
3. **Bear Import System** - ES5-compatible with comprehensive error boundaries
4. **Dimensional Framework Enhancement** - Balance redefined as "chaos vs coherence"
5. **Infinite Redraw Loop Fix** - Added `isDrawing` flag to prevent timeline loops
6. **Explanation Length Guidance** - Updated comprehensive doc for 160-220 char target

### 🔄 **Currently In Progress:**
- **JSON Object Verification** - Systematically checking data flow from JSON → Game
- **reviewKeywords Structure** ✅ VERIFIED - All 4 dimensions working with data, weights, keyphrases, explanations
- **Timeline Keyword Positioning** - Currently testing shoelace scenario

### ⚠️ **Immediate Issue Identified:**
**Explanation fields in pack-000 scenarios are still too short** - Updated guidance to 160-220 characters but haven't finished rewriting all scenario explanations to meet new requirements.

**Current**: ~105 characters (1.5 lines)
**Target**: 160-220 characters (2-3 lines) for better timeline captions

### 📋 **Next Priority Tasks:**
1. **URGENT**: Update ALL explanation fields in `/home/p0qp0q/Phuzzy/new-scenarios/scenariopack-000/wacky-scenarios-000.json` to meet 160-220 character target
2. **Continue JSON verification**: Timeline positioning, answerWeights, chaos vs coherence framework
3. **Complete pack-000 scenario explanation rewrite** using new guidance

### 🗂️ **Key Files:**
- **Timeline Chart**: `js/ui/timeline-chart.js` - Complete rewrite with thermodynamic splines
- **Scenario Manager**: `js/core/scenario-manager.js` - Bear import system with validation
- **Pack-000 Scenarios**: `new-scenarios/scenariopack-000/wacky-scenarios-000.json` - Needs explanation updates
- **Guidance Document**: `COMPREHENSIVE-AI-SCENARIO-GENERATION-DATASET.md` - Updated with 160-220 char requirements

### 🐻 **Bear System Status:**
- Import system working correctly ✅
- Preserving weighted keyword structure ✅  
- Error boundaries functioning ✅
- All 4 dimensions loading with data ✅

### 🎨 **Timeline Visualization Status:**
- Keyword dots + splines approach implemented ✅
- Thermodynamic cooling between keywords ✅
- Direct 0-100 Y-axis mapping (no multiplication) ✅
- Color coding: logic blue, emotion pink, balanced green, agenda orange ✅
- Infinite redraw loop fixed ✅

### 📊 **Current Verification Results:**
- **reviewKeywords structure**: ✅ WORKING - All 4 dimensions, data, weights, phrases, explanations present
- **Timeline positioning**: 🔄 TESTING - User examining shoelace scenario
- **Explanation length**: ⚠️ TOO SHORT - Still using old ~105 char format, need 160-220 chars

### 🎯 **Immediate Next Action:**
Update all explanation fields in pack-000 scenarios from current ~105 characters to 160-220 characters using enhanced guidance from comprehensive document.

**Example transformation needed:**
- **Before (too short)**: "Fabricated testing data and historical claims presented as systematic research evidence with authority confirmation"
- **After (target length)**: "Presents personal coincidence as systematic scientific discovery using fabricated testing methodology ('tested 23 friends over 6 weeks') and invented historical claims about Olympic athletes, creating false impression of systematic research validation through confirmation bias and authority persecution narratives"

Continue with systematic JSON verification after explanation updates are complete.
