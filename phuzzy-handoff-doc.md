# Phuzzy Think Tank - Development Handoff Document

## Project Overview
**Phuzzy Think Tank** is an educational game teaching critical thinking by having players identify whether arguments are flawed due to weak logic, emotional manipulation, hidden agendas, or are actually well-balanced.

## Key Components Explained

### 1. Scenario Structure
Each scenario contains:
- **Basic Info**: title, text, claim
- **Correct Answer**: "logic", "emotion", "balanced", or "agenda"
- **Answer Weights**: Percentage scores for each answer (100% = correct, 80-90% = close, etc.)
- **Dual Analysis**:
  - Logic scores: evidence, consistency, source, agenda (0-10)
  - Emotion scores: fear, belonging, pride, manipulation (0-10)
- **Educational Content**: wisdom quote, indicators, explanations

### 2. Game Flow
1. Load 10 scenarios (randomized from larger pool)
2. Present scenario with 4 answer options
3. User can spend honey pot for visual hint
4. Submit answer ‚Üí get nuanced feedback
5. Show comprehensive dual bear analysis
6. Next scenario or end game
7. Share results on social media

### 3. Scoring System
- **Perfect (100%)**: Correct answer ‚Üí üéâ
- **Close (80-90%)**: Related answer ‚Üí üòä
- **Partial (50-70%)**: Some merit ‚Üí ü§î
- **Wrong (0-40%)**: Missed point ‚Üí üò¢

### 4. Visual Design
- Purple gradient background
- White content cards with shadows
- Color coding:
  - Blue (üß†) = Logic
  - Pink (üíñ) = Emotion  
  - Yellow (‚öñÔ∏è) = Balanced
  - Red (üéØ) = Agenda

## NEW: Fallacy Card Collection System

### Overview
The game now features a collectible trading card system with 15 unique logical fallacy cards. Players discover cards by completing scenarios, with engaging visual feedback and collection bonuses.

### Key Features
- **15 Collectible Cards**: Each representing a specific logical fallacy (Appeal to Fear, False Dilemma, etc.)
- **Interactive Click-to-Collect**: Players must click cards to collect them (no auto-collection)
- **Single Row Collection Grid**: 15 cards displayed horizontally in Wisdom Bear's analysis section
- **Card Recall System**: Click collected cards to remove them from collection
- **Smart 3-Card Display Management**: Auto-hides oldest cards when more than 3 are collected
- **Flying Card Animations**: Cards animate from discovery location to collection grid
- **Sizzle Effects**: Random collected cards "sizzle" with spin/glow animation every 10 seconds
- **White Tooltips**: Hover shows fallacy names with purple text on white background
- **Rarity System**: Common, Uncommon, Rare cards with colored borders
- **Collection Bonuses**: 
  - 5+ cards: +10 RIZ bonus
  - 10+ cards: +25 RIZ bonus  
  - All 15 cards: +50 RIZ bonus + "Fallacy Card Master" badge
- **Enhanced Card Size**: Larger trading cards (280x420px) with bigger icons (5.5rem)

### Technical Implementation
- **Card Data**: Located in `/data/logical-fallacies.json`
- **Collection Tracking**: `ScoringSystem.collectedCards` Set stores discovered card IDs
- **Interactive System**: `collectCard()` and `recallCard()` functions handle click interactions
- **Display Management**: `manageDisplayedCards()` handles 3-card visibility limit
- **Visual Display**: Single row of 15 mini cards in `.bear-card-collection`
- **Animation**: `animateCardToCollection()` creates flying card effects
- **Sizzle Timer**: `startSizzleTimer()` triggers random card animations every 10 seconds
- **Styling**: Dedicated CSS in `/css/main.css` for `.mini-card` system with responsive breakpoints

### Files Modified
- `js/core/scoring-system.js` - Added collection tracking and bonus calculation
- `js/ui/bear-analysis.js` - Complete interactive card system with click handlers, recall, and sizzle animations
- `js/ui/quiz-interface.js` - Added collection bonus display on final results
- `js/ui/feedback-animator.js` - Updated "TRY AGAIN!" to thematic "duh=phuzzier"
- `css/main.css` - Added bear-themed collection styling with responsive design
- `css/fallacy-cards.css` - Enhanced card sizes and visual improvements
- `data/scenarios.json` - Added logical fallacy data to 5 scenarios (Climate Study, Investment Scam, Fitness Influencer, Parenting Forum)
- `index.html` - Updated final results, error handling, and Progress label

### Scenarios with Logical Fallacies
1. **Neighborhood Watch Alert** (#2) - Post Hoc, Slippery Slope, False Dilemma
2. **Climate Study** (#3) - Hasty Generalization, Appeal to Nature, Ad Hominem  
3. **Investment Scam** (#5) - False Scarcity, Hasty Generalization, Appeal to Fear
4. **Fitness Influencer** (#7) - Appeal to Tradition, False Scarcity, Ad Hominem
5. **Parenting Forum** (#9) - Hasty Generalization, False Dilemma, Slippery Slope

### Remaining Work
- **5 scenarios still need logical fallacy data**: Miracle Supplement (#1), Teacher's Concern (#4), Food Additive (#6), University Study (#8), Community Garden (#10)
- **SVG card graphics**: User mentioned creating bear-themed graphics for the 280x160px card art areas (card dimensions updated to 280x420px total)
- **Additional scenarios**: Expand beyond current 10 scenarios

### Recent Updates (Current Session)
- **Interactive card collection system** - Click to collect, click to recall
- **Single row layout** - All 15 cards in horizontal row with responsive breakpoints
- **Enhanced visual design** - Larger cards (280x420px), bigger icons (5.5rem), white tooltips with purple text
- **Smart card management** - Auto-hide oldest when >3 displayed, auto-show when recalled
- **Sizzle animations** - Random collected cards animate every 10 seconds with spin/glow
- **Button color matching** - Submit button now matches Next Scenario button blue (#3b82f6)
- **Larger balance labels** - "üß† Pure Logic", "‚öñÔ∏è Balanced", "üíñ Pure Emotion" increased to 1.3em
- **Thematic error messages** - "duh=phuzzier" and "üêª Bear with us - Reload"
- **Collection progress tracking** - Fixed final screen card count accuracy
- **Added logical fallacies** to 4 additional scenarios for total of 5/10 scenarios complete

## Critical Code Patterns to Preserve

### Answer Evaluation Logic
```javascript
// Nuanced scoring based on answer weights
if (userAnswer === correct) return 'perfect';
if (correct === 'emotion' && userAnswer === 'agenda') return 'close';
// ... etc
```

### Hint System (Simplified)
```javascript
// Visual hint without text manipulation
textElement.style.backgroundColor = hint.color;
textElement.style.border = `2px solid ${hint.borderColor}`;
```

### Performance Tracking
```javascript
// Track performance by answer type
performanceByType[correctType].total++;
if (score === 100) performanceByType[correctType].correct++;
```

## Documents/Assets to Include

### Required for Next Session:
1. **This handoff document**
2. **Original game HTML** (phuzzy-think-tank-fixed.html)
3. **Dual bear analysis HTML** (dual-bear-analysis.html) - for reference
4. **scenarios.json** - The extracted scenario data
5. **Scenario builder tool HTML** - For creating new content
6. **JS architecture file** - Modular structure
7. **Microgame API spec** - For honey pot games

### Optional but Helpful:
- Screenshots of game in action
- List of specific bugs encountered
- Notes on what teaching concepts work best
- Ideas for additional scenarios

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Priority:
1. **Fix the syntax errors** in the main game
2. **Create working modular version** with proper file separation
3. **Test locally** to ensure no crashes

### Then:
1. Set up GitHub repository
2. Implement dynamic scenario loading
3. Create first microgame prototype
4. Deploy to https://www.p0qp0q.com/thinkTank/

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Single JSON file vs API**: Started with JSON for simplicity, will add API later
2. **Honey pot hints**: Simplified from word highlighting to full-box coloring due to security constraints
3. **Modular architecture**: Allows testing, scaling, and team development
4. **Answer weights**: Enables nuanced feedback beyond right/wrong
5. **Dual analysis**: Teaching tool showing both logic AND emotion dimensions

## Contact for Questions
Project Owner: Allen Partridge
- Expertise: Gamification, educational technology, evidence-based learning
- Goal: Create scalable critical thinking education platform

## Final Notes
The game is feature-complete in prototype form but needs:
1. Bug fixes for deployment
2. Modularization for maintenance  
3. Content pipeline for thousands of scenarios
4. Microgame integration for engagement

The educational mechanics are solid - the Dual Bear Analysis effectively teaches recognition of both logical fallacies AND emotional manipulation tactics.
