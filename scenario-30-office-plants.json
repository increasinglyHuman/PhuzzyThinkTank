    "content": "üåø URGENT ALL-STAFF MEMO üåø\n\nFollowing last week's mandatory Plant Empathy Training, we're excited to announce Phase 2 of our GreenOffice Initiative!\n\nAs you know, studies show that offices with plants are 47% more productive (source: my nephew's biology report). But here's what THEY don't tell you - plants are also WATCHING US.\n\nMy ficus has been tracking my bathroom breaks. I counted. 17 times it turned its leaves when I got up. That's not phototropism, that's SURVEILLANCE.\n\nWhich is why I'm proposing PlantNet‚Ñ¢ - if they're going to spy, let's make it OFFICIAL:\n\nüìä Each plant gets a performance dashboard\nüéØ Oxygen output = Employee output\nüíö Wilting leaves = Written warnings\nüèÜ Flowering = Promotion eligibility\n\nBut wait, there's MORE! I've discovered that different plants judge different skills:\n\n- Succulents: Time management (they survive neglect)\n- Ferns: Attention to detail (so needy!)\n- Snake plants: Leadership (they're literally called mother-in-law's tongue)\n- Cacti: Conflict resolution (approach carefully)\n\nJennifer from Accounting says I'm \"anthropomorphizing\" and \"having a breakdown\" but HER SPIDER PLANT HAS 47 BABIES. You know what that means? She's hoarding resources! Classic Jennifer.\n\nI've started interviewing my plants for 360 feedback:\n\nMe: \"How would you rate my leadership?\"\nPothos: *drops a leaf*\nMe: \"I DESERVE THAT FEEDBACK\"\n\nSome \"scientists\" claim plants don't have consciousness, but explain THIS:\n- My bamboo grows faster during performance review season\n- The peace lily ONLY blooms when I hit my KPIs\n- The office bonsai literally shaped itself into a dollar sign\n\nCoincidence? I THINK NOT.\n\nHR says this is \"not based in reality\" but they also said \"unlimited PTO\" meant unlimited, so who's the real liar here?\n\nI'm implementing a new policy: All meetings must include plant representation. They've been in every meeting anyway, silently judging our PowerPoints. Time to give them a VOICE.\n\nNext week: Chlorophyll drug testing (you can't hide your true nature from plants!)\n\n#PlantBasedManagement #PhotosynthesisProductivity #GreenCollarWorkers #NatureKnowsBest\n\nP.S. The rubber plant in Conference Room B asked me to tell you all it's disappointed in Q3 results. Don't shoot the messenger!",
