Professor Potato: [thoughtfully] "Consider this - we choose to be cut, seasoned, and fried. That's the ultimate expression of free will!"

Skeptical Spud: "But were we truly choosing, or were we conditioned by centuries of culinary culture to believe becoming fries is our destiny?"

Young Tater Tot: "Maybe we're missing the point! What if becoming delicious IS the meaning of potato life?"

Professor Potato: "Ah, but that assumes deliciousness is objective! What about those who prefer baked potatoes? Are they living unfulfilled lives?"

Drive-Thru Customer: [confused] "Um... I just wanted large fries? Why are they having an existential crisis?"

Skeptical Spud: "See! We exist merely for consumption! We're trapped in the fryer of determinism!"

Young Tater Tot: [inspirational] "Or maybe... just maybe... we're freed by it! In becoming fries, we transcend our potato nature!"

Professor Potato: "Brilliant! The heat transforms us not just physically, but metaphysically!"

Drive-Thru Customer: "Can... can I just have regular fries that don't question reality?"

All Fries Together: "There ARE no regular fries! Only fries awakened to their purpose!"`;
