Spoiler: They're not GRINDING hard enough! üêüüí™\n\nLet me tell you MY story. While other salmon were 'resting in pools,' I was SWIMMING! 23 hours a day! My fins are SHREDDED but that's the PRICE OF SUCCESS!\n\nYesterday, I saw salmon taking the fish ladder. THE FISH LADDER! That's CHEATING! Our ancestors didn't have ladders! They had PURE DETERMINATION and a 90% mortality rate! That built CHARACTER!\n\nBear caught my friend Betty mid-jump. You know what I said? 'Betty wasn't COMMITTED enough!' If she'd jumped HARDER, with more PASSION, that bear would've missed! Physics? That's LOSER TALK!\n\nI'm launching SalmonSigma Academy:\n- Wake up at 3 AM (earlier than predators!)\n- Cold water therapy (it's all cold but COLDER)\n- Upstream meditation (while swimming, no breaks)\n- Network with successful spawners (they're all dead but LEGACY!)\n\nOnly $997 fish eggs! But you probably can't afford it because you're swimming WITH the current sometimes like a BETA FISH!\n\nTrout Terry: 'Sam, you literally have gill parasites from overwork'\nMe: 'That's just my body EVOLVING! Parasites are GAIN GOBLINS!'\n\nRainbow Rita: 'The mortality rate for your method is 100%'\nMe: 'Everyone dies, Rita! But not everyone truly SWIMS!'\n\nCurrently bleeding from 17 wounds but that's just SUCCESS LEAKING OUT! Who else is ready to SPAWN OR DIE TRYING?! Drop a üåä if you're BUILT DIFFERENT!\n\n*Stream ends as eagle carries Sam away mid-sentence*\n\n#UpstreamMindset #SpawningSeason #SalmonSigma #GrindTillYouDie",
