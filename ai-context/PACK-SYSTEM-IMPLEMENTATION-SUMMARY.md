# Scenario Pack System Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **Pack Configuration System** (`js/core/scenario-packs-config.js`)
- Created centralized configuration for all available scenario packs
- Supports multiple selection modes: random, sequential, user-choice, config
- Currently set to load Pack 002 (our newly created pack) via 'config' mode
- Tracks 5 packs:
  - `original-v1`: Classic scenarios (disabled/retiring)
  - `original-v2`: Classic scenarios with v2 enhancements
  - `pack-001`: First AI-generated pack
  - `pack-002`: Modern Digital Dilemmas (just created)
  - `complete`: Combined collection

### 2. **Updated ScenarioManager** (`js/core/scenario-manager.js`)
- Now accepts pack selection configuration
- Automatically selects pack based on config settings
- Handles both v1 and v2 format scenarios
- Logs which pack is being loaded
- Remembers last used pack in localStorage

### 3. **UI Pack Indicator** (`index.html`)
- Added pack name display in game header
- Shows which scenario pack is currently loaded
- Updates automatically after initialization

### 4. **V2 Hint System Enhancement** (`js/core/honey-pot-manager.js`)
- Updated to use custom hints from v2 scenarios when available
- Falls back to generic hints for v1 scenarios
- Passes hint keywords (though not yet highlighted in UI)

### 5. **Test Infrastructure**
- Created `test-v2-compatibility.html` for testing v2 format
- Verifies all v2 fields are present and properly structured

## Current Configuration

```javascript
// Set to load Pack 002 specifically
window.PACK_SELECTION_CONFIG = {
    mode: 'config',
    defaultPack: 'pack-002',
    rememberLastPack: true
};
```

## What Works

✅ Multiple pack support with configuration
✅ V2 format compatibility (all fields recognized)
✅ Custom hints from v2 scenarios
✅ Non-rounded answer weights (e.g., 73, 41, 91, 38)
✅ Pack info display in UI
✅ Backward compatibility with v1 format

## Potential Enhancements

1. **Keyword Highlighting**: The v2 hints include keywords that could be highlighted in the scenario text
2. **Pack Selection UI**: Currently using config mode, but could add dropdown for user selection
3. **Mixed Pack Mode**: Allow scenarios from multiple packs in one game
4. **Dimension Analysis Display**: v2 includes rich dimension analysis not yet shown in UI
5. **Peak Moments Visualization**: v2 includes peak moments data for timeline display

## Testing Next Steps

1. Load the game and verify Pack 002 loads successfully
2. Check that all 10 scenarios display properly
3. Test hint system with v2 custom hints
4. Verify scoring works with non-rounded weights
5. Check for any console errors with new fields

## Quick Test

Open `index.html` in a browser and check:
- Pack name shows as "Modern Digital Dilemmas" in header
- Scenarios load without errors
- Hints show custom messages when honey pots are used
- Game completes successfully with all 10 scenarios

## Switching Packs

To test different packs, edit `js/core/scenario-packs-config.js`:
- Change `mode` to 'random' for random pack selection
- Change `defaultPack` to test specific packs
- Set `mode` to 'sequential' to cycle through packs
