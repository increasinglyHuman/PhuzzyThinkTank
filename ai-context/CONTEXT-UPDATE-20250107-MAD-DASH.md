# Context Update - January 7, 2025
## Phuzzy's Mad Dash Racing Game Development

### Session Overview
Extended development session on the physics-based racing mini-game with focus on parallax scrolling, fair racing mechanics, and AI behavior improvements.

### Critical Issue: Ball Rendering
**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Some balls (green/blue) not rendering in v2.0.6-debug
- Added extensive debug logging
- Fixed viewport width checking 
- Issue appears to be z-order or drawing related
- Red debug rectangles added to verify drawing execution

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Complete Parallax System Redesign (v2.0.0)
**Before**: Track lengths varied dramatically due to parallax compensation
- Yellow track was 10x longer than Blue track!
- Made racing unfair and confusing

**After**: All tracks same logical length
- Parallax is purely visual
- Fair racing with visual depth preserved
- Matches classic racing game design patterns

#### 2. AI Independence Implementation (v2.0.1-2.0.2)
**Before**: AI racers dependent on player clicks
- Would stop when player stopped
- Required player's first click to start
- Used player's click rate

**After**: True AI autonomy
- Independent click timing (200-400ms intervals)
- Persistent personality traits per racer
- Continue racing regardless of player activity
- More realistic forward/backward click ratio (80/20)

#### 3. Research & Best Practices
Investigated parallax scrolling in classic racing games:
- Pole Position, OutRun use visual parallax only
- All lanes exist in same "world space"
- Perspective affects rendering, not physics
- Simple solutions often best

### Technical Details

#### Current Physics Configuration:
```javascript
{
  gravity: 0.0003,
  friction: 0.985,
  pushForce: 0.001,
  maxVelocity: 0.002,
  momentumConservation: 0.7
}
```

#### AI Personality System:
```javascript
{
  clickRate: 0.6-1.4x base speed,
  baseInterval: 200-400ms,
  baseAccuracy: 60-90%,
  forwardPushRatio: 80%,
  backwardPushRatio: 20%
}
```

### Next Session Priorities

1. **FIX BALL RENDERING** (Critical)
   - Debug why green/blue balls aren't visible
   - Check canvas coordinate calculations
   - Verify z-order drawing logic

2. **Remove Debug Code**
   - Clean up console.log statements
   - Remove red debug rectangles
   - Update version to v2.1.0

3. **Polish & Testing**
   - Verify AI continues when player stops
   - Test race completion for all racers
   - Fine-tune click detection areas

### Lessons Learned

1. **Parallax Complexity**: What seems like a good idea (length compensation) can create cascading problems
2. **AI Independence**: True autonomy requires breaking dependencies on player actions
3. **Visual vs Gameplay**: Keep visual effects separate from gameplay mechanics
4. **Incremental Testing**: Debug visualization (markers, logs) essential for complex systems

### Memory Usage Notes
- Canvas limited to 16000px width (was 80000px originally)
- Efficient animation loops crucial
- Minimal particle effects for Pi deployment

### Integration Status
Ready for integration once rendering issue resolved. Mini-game provides good variety from main quiz gameplay while maintaining bear theme.
