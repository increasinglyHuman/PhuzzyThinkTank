# Context Update: Bear Runner Mini-Game Physics Enhancement

## Session Summary
Enhanced the Bear Runner mini-game with sophisticated physics simulation and spline deformation, creating a challenging curve-racing experience.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Spline Deformation System
- Implemented instant maximum deformation (6x peak amplification + 100 unit wave interference)
- Created dynamic scaling to keep deformed curves within canvas bounds
- Added baseline offset calculation to position lowest point at 0%

### 2. Physics Engine Improvements
- **Downhill Physics**: Momentum-based gravity multiplier, speed-dependent drag (up to 70%)
- **Uphill Physics**: Opposing gravity force, slope-dependent friction (0.85-0.92)
- **Valley Responsiveness**: Reduced friction (0.98) for better control
- **Curve Adhesion**: Multi-step integration prevents overshooting peaks
- **Curvature Correction**: Second derivative calculation pulls ball toward curve at extremes

### 3. Push Mechanism Enhancements
- Increased base push force to 0.05 (forward) and -0.03 (backward)
- Added slope-dependent push effectiveness (30% minimum on steep uphills)
- Implemented proximity detection (40 pixel range)
- Created three visual feedback types (forward/backward/miss)

### 4. Click Detection Fix
- Updated `getBearScreenPosition()` to use same deformation calculations as rendering
- Synchronized min/max scaling between physics and visual systems
- Fixed coordinate transformation to match deformed curve exactly

### Core Physics Values
```javascript
// Deformation
difficultyMultiplier = 6.0;   // Peak amplification
waveAmplitude = 100;          // Wave interference

// Physics Constants
baseGravity = 0.0003;
maxVelocity = 0.015;
minVelocity = 0.0003;

// Terrain-Specific
downhillFriction = 0.975;
uphillFriction = 0.85-0.92;  // Slope dependent
valleyFriction = 0.98;

// Push Forces
forwardPush = 0.05;          // Reduced by slope on uphills

```

### Key Algorithms
1. **Slope Calculation**: Samples ahead 0.005 units with interpolation
2. **Curve Adhesion**: 5-step integration with Y-difference threshold
3. **Curvature Correction**: Second derivative approximation for visual adhesion
4. **Dynamic Scaling**: Range-based normalization with baseline offset

## Files Modified
- `/js/ui/timeline-chart.js`: Core physics simulation and rendering
- `/js/ui/timeline-analysis.js`: Click detection and push mechanics

## Future Considerations
Created comprehensive documentation (`BEAR-MINIGAME-TECHNICAL-DOC.md`) outlining potential gamification features including obstacles, power-ups, enemies, upgrades, and multiplayer modes.

## Next Steps
The mini-game is fully functional with polished physics. Ready for additional features like collectibles, scoring systems, or visual effects based on the documented gamification ideas.
