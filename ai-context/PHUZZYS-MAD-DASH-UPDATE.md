# Phuzzy's Mad Dash - Development Update

## Current Version: v2.0.6-debug

### Session Summary (January 7, 2025)

This session focused on fixing critical issues with the physics-based racing mini-game, particularly around parallax scrolling, fair racing mechanics, and AI behavior.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Parallax System Overhaul (v2.0.0)
**Problem**: The parallax length compensation was creating extreme track length differences:
- Blue (closest): 1x length
- Green: 2x length  
- Pink: 3.33x length
- Yellow: 10x length (!)

**Solution**: 
- Removed length compensation entirely - all tracks are now the same logical length (0-1)
- Parallax is now purely visual, not affecting gameplay
- Changed parallax factors from 0.7-0.1 range to 0.95-0.80 range

### 2. AI Click Mechanics (v2.0.1-2.0.2)
**Problems**:
- AI would stop clicking when player stopped
- AI was gated by player's first click
- Too many backward pushes (40%)

**Solutions**:
- AI now has independent click timing (200-400ms base interval)
- Each AI has persistent traits:
  - Click rate multiplier (0.6x-1.4x)
  - Base accuracy (60-90%)
- Reduced backward push rate from 40% to 20%
- AI continues clicking regardless of player activity

### 3. Visual and Positioning Fixes
- Moved starting position from 0% to 1% to allow left-side clicking
- Added debug markers showing actual positions vs visual positions
- Fixed viewport checking (was using full canvas width instead of viewport width)
- Added progress markers at 25%, 50%, 75%, and FINISH for each track

### 4. Bear Names
- Changed from generic colors to personality names:
  - Blue: Phuzzy (player)
  - Green: Bumble
  - Pink: Honey  
  - Yellow: Grizzly

## Current Issues

### 1. Ball Rendering Problem (CRITICAL)
- Some balls (particularly green and blue) are not rendering
- Debug logs suggest it might be a z-order or viewport calculation issue
- Added debug rectangles to verify drawing code execution

### 2. Potential Causes:
- Canvas coordinate system confusion
- Viewport boundary checking might be too restrictive
- Z-order drawing loop may have issues
- Possible ctx save/restore imbalance

## Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Fix ball rendering** - Debug why certain balls aren't visible
2. **Remove debug code** once rendering is fixed
3. **Test AI independence** - Verify AI racers continue when player stops

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Race Statistics Dashboard**
   - Real-time speed indicators
   - Click efficiency metrics
   - Position history graphs

2. **AI Personality System**
   - Different click strategies per bear
   - Learning from player behavior
   - Difficulty progression

3. **Visual Polish**
   - Particle effects for clicks
   - Trail effects for speed
   - Victory animations

4. **Game Balance**
   - Tune physics parameters
   - Balance AI difficulty
   - Add difficulty modes

## Technical Notes

### Key Physics Parameters:
```javascript
- Gravity: 0.0003
- Friction: 0.985
- Push Force: 0.001
- Max Velocity: 0.002
- Momentum Conservation: 0.7
```

### AI Configuration:
```javascript
- Base Click Interval: 200-400ms
- Click Rate Variation: 0.6x-1.4x
- Base Accuracy: 60-90%
- Forward/Backward Ratio: 80/20
```

### Parallax Settings:
```javascript
- Blue (main): 1.00
- Green: 0.90
- Pink: 0.85  
- Yellow: 0.80
```

## Debugging Commands

Check console for:
- Ball processing logs
- Position calculations
- Viewport checks
- Click event logs

## Integration Notes

This mini-game is designed to be integrated into the main Phuzzy Think Tank game as a fun interlude or bonus game. The racing mechanics use the same bear characters but in a completely different context, providing variety in gameplay.

## Memory Considerations

Given the Raspberry Pi deployment target:
- Canvas size is limited to 16000px width
- Minimal particle effects to reduce memory usage
- Efficient animation frame updates
- Careful management of click event listeners
