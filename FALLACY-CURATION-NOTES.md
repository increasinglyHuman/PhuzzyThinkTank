# Fallacy Curation Notes for Phuzzy Think Tank
**Date:** January 6, 2025
**Reference:** Wikipedia's List of Fallacies

## The Challenge of Comprehensive Lists

Wikipedia lists **100+ fallacies** across multiple categories:
- Formal fallacies (logic structure errors)
- Informal fallacies (content/context errors)
- Cognitive biases (not technically fallacies)
- Mathematical fallacies
- Measurement fallacies
- And many subcategories...

## Why Our 15-Card System Works Better

### 1. **Pedagogical Focus**
- Students can actually remember 15 concepts
- Each card feels distinct and meaningful
- Avoids "fallacy fatigue" from too many similar concepts

### 2. **Real-World Relevance**
Our selection prioritizes fallacies that:
- Appear frequently in social media
- Show up in marketing/advertising
- Occur in political discourse
- Affect daily decision-making

### 3. **Game Design Principles**
- Collectible card games work best with 15-20 unique items
- Each card needs distinct visual identity (icon)
- Players should feel accomplishment collecting all cards
- Too many cards = completionist frustration

## Future Expansion Ideas (from Wikipedia)

If we ever expand beyond 15, these would be strong candidates:

### Tier 1 Priority
1. **Gambler's Fallacy** - Extremely common, teaches probability
2. **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - Critical for decision-making
3. **No True Scotsman** - Fun to identify, memorable name
4. **Begging the Question** - Important for circular reasoning

### Tier 2 Priority
5. **False Attribution** - Relevant in misinformation age
6. **Texas Sharpshooter** - Great visual metaphor
7. **Survivorship Bias** - Important for data literacy
8. **Dunning-Kruger Effect** - Though technically a bias, not fallacy

## Design Philosophy

Rather than trying to be comprehensive like Wikipedia, Phuzzy Think Tank succeeds by being:
- **Focused**: 15 memorable fallacies > 100 forgettable ones
- **Practical**: Real scenarios kids might encounter
- **Fun**: Collectible cards with personality
- **Educational**: Deep understanding > surface knowledge

## The "Pokémon Principle"
Just as Pokémon started with 151 (not 1000+), we start with 15 core fallacies. This creates:
- Achievable mastery
- Memorable characters (each fallacy has personality)
- Room for "expansion packs" later
- Focus on quality over quantity

## Conclusion
Wikipedia's exhaustive list validates our curation approach. By selecting the 15 most impactful fallacies and creating engaging scenarios around them, we've built something more educationally valuable than a comprehensive reference.

### Future Considerations
- **Pack 2**: Could add 5-7 more fallacies as "Rare Finds"
- **Boss Cards**: Ultra-rare fallacies for advanced players
- **Combo Cards**: Show how fallacies work together
- **Counter Cards**: Teach defenses against each fallacy

The key is maintaining quality and distinctiveness with each addition.
