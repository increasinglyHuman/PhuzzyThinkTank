  "text": "NextPaw neighborhood app - Posted by GoldenDoodleMom:\n\nðŸš¨ URGENT: Dangerous breeds at Barkington Dog Park! ðŸš¨\n\nJust witnessed a PIT BULL playing with other dogs. PLAYING! Don't let the tail wagging fool you - I've done my research!\n\nFacts that MATTER:\n- Pit bulls = 65% of attacks (found on DogBiteStats.net)\n- My neighbor's cousin's friend was bitten in 1987\n- They have LOCKING JAWS (scientifically proven!!!)\n- Bred for fighting = ALWAYS dangerous\n\nPit owner claimed 'Daisy is a therapy dog.' Sure, therapy for TRAUMA VICTIMS after she attacks! ðŸ™„\n\nMeanwhile, my Princess (Standard Poodle) has bitten 3 people but that's DIFFERENT:\n- Mailman was 'suspicious' \n- Child shouldn't have run past us\n- Vet 'moved too fast'\nPoodles bite from FEAR, not aggression. Totally different!\n\nI started a petition: BAN BULLY BREEDS FROM BARKINGTON\nAlready 12 signatures! (Mostly me and my alt accounts but still!)\n\nBeagle owner: 'My dog was attacked by a Golden Retriever last week'\nMe: 'That's anecdotal. Statistics don't lie!'\nBeagle owner: 'You just used anecdotes about pit bulls'\nMe: 'Blocked for supporting dog fighting'\n\nIf you care about SAFETY, join my 6AM patrol group. We document every 'dangerous' breed. Bring coffee and prejudice! â˜•\n\nP.S. That 'Daisy' licked my hand. Probably tasting me for later. ðŸ˜±\n\n#BarkingtonSafety #BreedMatters #NotAllDogsButDefinitelyPitBulls",
