LIFE IS SUFFERING.\"\nGym Partner: \"...8 it is\"\n\nI've discovered the TRUTH:\n- Descartes: \"I think therefore I am\"\n- Me: \"I lift therefore I am SWOLE\"\n\nThe barbell doesn't care about your feelings = STOICISM\nProtein timing windows = KANT'S CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE\nMind-muscle connection = PHENOMENOLOGY\n\nSome \"professor\" at the juice bar said I'm \"missing the point\" of philosophy but I COUNTED HIS MACROS - only 12g protein!! How can you understand Plato on a CATABOLIC STATE??\n\nI'm launching my new program:\nüíä PHILOSOPHICAL PHYSIQUE üíä\n- Week 1: Bicep curls + Being vs Nothingness\n- Week 2: Squats + Sartre's bad faith (never skip leg day = AUTHENTICITY)\n- Week 3: Deadlifts + Lifting the dead weight of nihilism\n- Week 4: Deload + Meditation on mortality\n\nJust discovered that \"gymnasium\" comes from Greek meaning \"naked exercise\" - THE ANCIENTS KNEW!\n\nCurrently writing my thesis: \"The Myth of Sisyphus Had Bad Form: A Critical Analysis\"\n\nChapter 1: Why Camus Never Hit His Protein Goals\nChapter 2: The Phenomenology of the Pump\nChapter 3: Heidegger's Being-Toward-Gains\n\n#PhilosophicalFitness #ThinkAndGrow #PlatonicGains #ExistentialPump #ProteinWisdom #GymBroSocrates #SwoleSoul #CamusCanLift\n\nP.S. My bicep just asked me if free will exists. I told it we're doing forced reps. PARADOX ACHIEVED.",
