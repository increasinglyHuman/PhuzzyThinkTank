  "text": "Posted by @ChillyPenguin on IceBerg (Antarctic's #1 social platform):\n\nüßä Day 147 of my MINIMALIST ICE CAVE journey! üêß\n\nWhile you mainland animals cling to your 'nests' and 'dens' full of STUFF, I've discovered TRUE FREEDOM living with just ice!\n\nMy morning routine:\n- 4AM: Sunrise meditation on iceberg (it's summer, sun never sets but whatever)\n- 5AM: Krill smoothie (only 1 type of food = SIMPLE)\n- 6AM: Argue with colony about leaving\n- 7AM: Instagram my empty ice shelf\n\nYesterday, Emperor Eddie said I'm 'just cold and hungry.' He doesn't understand that shivering is my body's NATURAL HEATING SYSTEM! Why would I want a cozy huddle when I can have AUTHENTIC SUFFERING?\n\nSeal neighbor: 'You literally have frostbite'\nMe: 'It's called BIOHACKING, Sharon'\n\nMy course 'From Waddle to Wow: Embrace the Ice' launches tomorrow! Only üêü500 fish! Learn how to:\n- Let go of warmth addiction\n- Find happiness in hypothermia  \n- Monetize your misery\n\nHaters say I'm secretly sneaking into the colony huddle at night. FAKE NEWS! That thermal camera footage is doctored! I'm out here living my TRUTH!\n\nBTW, selling my spot in the colony. It's prime real estate - center of huddle, maximum warmth. Starting bid: 1000 fish. (But remember, possessions don't matter! üòâ)\n\n#IceMinimalism #AntarcticInfluencer #NotActuallyCold #FrozenButFree",
