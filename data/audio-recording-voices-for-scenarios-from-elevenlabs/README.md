# ElevenLabs Voice Generation for Scenarios

## Project Overview
This directory contains audio recordings of scenario content generated using ElevenLabs' text-to-speech API. Each scenario from our game will have corresponding voice narration files in MP3 format for web playback.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Prerequisites
- **ElevenLabs Account**: Required for API access
- **API Key**: Found in profile settings after account creation
- **Python Environment**: For running the generation scripts

### 2. Technical Specifications
- **Audio Format**: MP3 at 128kbps (web-optimized)
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1kHz
- **Voice Model**: eleven_multilingual_v2 (highest quality)
- **Fallback Model**: eleven_flash_v2_5 (for real-time needs, 75ms latency)

### 4. Integration Points
- Web Audio API for playback control
- Preloading strategy for smooth user experience
- Progressive loading based on user progress
- Fallback to text display if audio fails

## Victories Log

### Victory #1: Careful Architecture Planning
- Chose MP3 format for universal browser compatibility
- Structured folders by scenario ID for easy mapping
- Planned for both batch generation and incremental updates

### Victory #2: API Research Completed
- Identified optimal voice models for quality vs. latency
- Found streaming capabilities for future real-time features
- Discovered emotional context features in text interpretation

## Next Steps
1. Obtain ElevenLabs API credentials
2. Create voice generation script
3. Test with single scenario
4. Batch process all scenarios
5. Integrate audio playback into game UI

## Notes
- ElevenLabs supports 32 languages
- Emotional context can be influenced by punctuation and descriptive text
- Rate limits depend on subscription tier
- Consider caching generated audio to minimize API calls
