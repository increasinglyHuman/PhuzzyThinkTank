# AI Scenario Generation Specification v2 for Phuzzy's Think Tank

## Overview
Generate educational scenarios that teach critical thinking through nuanced manipulation tactics. This updated spec incorporates learnings from successful generation of Pack 001.

## Key Learnings Applied

### 1. The "Winking Admission" Pattern
Include scenarios where manipulators acknowledge their tactics while still employing them:
- "Correlation, not causation ðŸ˜‰" while implying causation
- "I know this sounds like a sales pitch, but..." followed by sales pitch
- "Not to be dramatic..." before maximum drama
- Creates false transparency that disarms skepticism

### 2. Statistical Whiplash Technique
Present conflicting data that reveals genuine complexity:
- "78% support it, but only 23% would pay for it"
- "Reduces risk by 50% (from 2 in 100,000 to 1 in 100,000)"
- "99% effective* (*in laboratory conditions, real world varies)"
- Shows gap between stated values and actual behavior

### 3. Voice Authenticity Requirements
Match writing style to platform and sender:
- **Email**: From/Subject/Body structure, corporate speak
- **Social Media**: Platform-specific (NextDoor for neighborhood, LinkedIn for professional)
- **Group Posts**: "Ladies," "Moms," "Team," for immediate belonging
- **Authority Voice**: "Professor here," "20-year nurse," "Former Google engineer"

### 4. Emotional Cascade Mapping
Layer emotions for maximum impact:
- **Parenting**: Concern â†’ Fear â†’ Guilt â†’ Pride in "protecting"
- **Financial**: Curiosity â†’ FOMO â†’ Panic â†’ Relief through action
- **Health**: Worry â†’ Research â†’ Terror â†’ Solution via product
- **Professional**: Ambition â†’ Anxiety â†’ Compliance â†’ Resentment

### 5. Balanced Scenario Indicators
True balance includes these specific phrases:
- "What questions should I even be asking?"
- "I'm genuinely conflicted"
- "Both sides have valid points, but..."
- "Can anyone help me understand?"
- NO rhetorical questions - only genuine requests for input

## Enhanced Generation Requirements

### Research Phase (5-10 minutes per topic)
Before generating, briefly research:
1. **Current Events**: One trending controversy in your topic area
2. **New Statistics**: Find 2-3 real statistics to ground scenarios
3. **Platform Language**: How people actually write in that context
4. **Emerging Scams**: Latest manipulation tactics in that domain

### Complexity Requirements v2

Each scenario must include 4+ of these elements (increased from 3):

1. **Mixed Validity** - True facts, false conclusions
2. **Competing Authorities** - Multiple experts disagreeing
3. **Emotional Layering** - Primary emotion masks secondary
4. **Time Pressure Gradients** - Escalating urgency
5. **Social Proof Manipulation** - Real testimonials misused
6. **Statistical Gymnastics** - True numbers, deceptive presentation
7. **Narrative Arc** - Story that shifts perspective mid-way
8. **Hedged Certainty** - Disclaimers followed by absolute claims
9. **False Balance** - Token acknowledgment before dismissal
10. **Scope Shifting** - Specific examples become universal claims
11. **Winking Admission** (NEW) - Acknowledging manipulation while doing it
12. **Platform Authenticity** (NEW) - Voice matches medium perfectly
13. **The Reluctant Seller** (NEW) - Extensive denial before pitch
14. **Transparent Agenda** (NEW) - Open about goals, still manipulative

### Answer Weight Calculation v2

#### Enhanced Precision Requirements
- Calculate to decimal, round naturally (71.4 â†’ 71, not 70)
- Ensure variety in final digits across pack
- Weights should create "fingerprints" - no two scenarios with identical distributions
- If balanced is correct answer, it should score 85+

#### Weight Patterns by Type
**High Emotion Scenarios (emotion = correct):**
- Emotion: 76-95
- Logic: 15-35
- Balanced: 5-20
- Agenda: Variable

**Sophisticated Agenda (agenda = correct):**
- Agenda: 75-93
- Emotion: 45-70
- Logic: 25-45
- Balanced: 10-30

**Genuine Balance (balanced = correct):**
- Balanced: 84-96
- Logic: 55-75
- Emotion: 40-65
- Agenda: 15-40

**Logic-Driven (logic = correct):**
- Logic: 72-89
- Emotion: 35-65
- Balanced: 30-50
- Agenda: 20-50

### Peak Moments Selection v2
Choose keywords that would visually "pop" in timeline:
- **Logic**: Statistics with %, specific numbers, "study", "research"
- **Emotion**: CAPS WORDS, multiple punctuation!!!, emoji usage
- **Balanced**: "however", "but", "although", genuine questions
- **Agenda**: Prices, "DM", "register", "limited", website URLs

### Dimension Analysis Writing v2
Must describe PROGRESSION through text:
- Start with "how" or action verb
- Reference specific movement/change
- Include specific examples in quotes
- 15-20 words maximum
- Must be unique to that scenario's narrative

Good: "Fear escalates from vague concern to panic - 'suspicious' becomes 'trafficking' without evidence."
Bad: "Uses emotional manipulation throughout the text."

## Scenario Topics for Pack 002

Research these briefly before writing:

1. **AI in Education** - Cheating detection, personalized learning, teacher replacement fears
2. **Remote Work Culture** - Productivity monitoring, work-life balance, career advancement
3. **Youth Sports Pressure** - College scholarships, parent investment, child burnout
4. **Dating App Psychology** - Algorithm manipulation, profile optimization, authenticity
5. **Sustainable Fashion** - Fast fashion guilt, greenwashing, cost barriers
6. **Neighborhood Surveillance** - Ring cameras, privacy, community safety
7. **Dietary Tribalism** - Keto vs vegan, nutrition science, identity politics
8. **Gig Economy Reality** - Freedom narrative, exploitation, financial instability
9. **Parenting Influencers** - Gentle parenting, mom shaming, commercialization
10. **Climate Anxiety** - Individual action, corporate responsibility, eco-guilt

## Memory-Conscious Generation

Generate in batches of 4 scenarios:
1. Create complete JSON structure for 4 scenarios
2. Validate all fields present
3. Check memory usage
4. Continue with next batch

## Quality Checklist v2

Before finalizing each scenario:
- [ ] Voice matches platform/sender authenticity
- [ ] 4+ complexity elements clearly present
- [ ] Weights calculated with decimal precision
- [ ] Peak moments would visually stand out
- [ ] Dimension analysis describes progression
- [ ] Educational value teaches recognizable pattern
- [ ] No two scenarios have similar weight distributions
- [ ] Balanced scenarios show genuine complexity
- [ ] Research elements grounded in reality

## Example Patterns to Avoid

1. **Generic Authority**: "Experts say" â†’ Use "MIT study published in Nature (2024)"
2. **Vague Threats**: "Bad things might happen" â†’ "637 families lost homes (County records)"
3. **Simple Emotion**: "This is scary!" â†’ Build emotional cascade through narrative
4. **Obvious Agenda**: "Buy now!" at start â†’ Build credibility first, soft pitch later

## Success Metrics

A well-crafted scenario pack should:
- Teach 10 distinct manipulation patterns
- Include 3-4 genuinely balanced scenarios
- Show progression in difficulty (1-4 rating)
- Cover diverse topics and platforms
- Feel current and realistic
- Make players think "I've seen this exact thing!"

Remember: The goal is education through recognition. Players should finish thinking "Now I understand how that works!" not just "That was obviously fake."
