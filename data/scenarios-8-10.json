Says hospitalizations dropped 74% where implemented. But my sister-in-law's naturopath showed her VAERS data - 847 'adverse events' reported! That sounds TERRIFYING! üò± Though when I looked closer, most were 'injection site redness.' CDC website has SO much data I can't make sense of it all. My mother says 'we survived without all these vaccines!' True, but her brother died of measles at age 3. I want to protect my baby but not harm her. Some moms here say 'trust your gut!' Others share scientific studies. I'm drowning in conflicting information. What questions should I even be asking? Feeling like a terrible mother either way. üòî",

That's a full WEEK of learning lost! Finland (top education globally) tests kids ONCE before age 16. Meanwhile, Pearson made $4.5 billion last year selling these tests. Coincidence? Teachers say they're forced to 'teach to the test.' One whispered: 'I haven't taught art in months.' Kids coming home crying, saying 'I'm stupid' after practice tests. Mine developed stomach aches every test week. Yes, data helps identify struggling students. But at what cost? Other districts let parents opt out - why can't we? School board elections are next month. Three candidates promise change, two defend status quo. I'm organizing an info session Tuesday 7pm. Not telling you how to vote, just sharing facts. Though honestly? Our babies deserve better than bubble sheets determining their futures. Reply if interested - strength in numbers!\n\nSarah Mitchell\nParent of two Eagles",
