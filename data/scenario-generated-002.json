      "text": "From: Prof_Martinez@StateU.edu\nSubject: Re: Your Essay Flag\n\nDear Sophie,\n\nOur AI detector flagged your essay as 87% likely AI-generated. I know, I know - these detectors have a 9% false positive rate (MIT study, 2024). Your writing did suddenly improve. Last semester: C+ average. This essay: graduate-level vocabulary. But maybe you just worked harder? I've seen GPTDetect flag Shakespeare as AI. Literally. Yet when I asked you to explain your thesis in person, you struggled. Look, 31% of students admit using ChatGPT (anonymous survey). I'm not naive. But I also had a student last month wrongly accused - nearly destroyed her scholarship chances. The irony? I use Claude to write recommendation letters (don't tell admin üòâ). Here's my offer: Rewrite it by hand, in class, tomorrow. Similar quality = A. Can't reproduce it = Academic Integrity meeting. Fair? I'm trying to be. This whole system is broken, honestly.\n\n-Prof M",

You're right - I only quoted 3 climate scientists (MIT, Stanford, NOAA). Super one-sided! üôÑ\n\nPer your edits, I've now 'balanced' it:\n- Dr. Phillips (97% consensus): 'Unprecedented heat patterns'\n- Bob's Weather Blog: 'It's just summer, folks!'\n- Equal word count! ‚úì\n\nAlso added your suggested headline: 'Experts Divided on Heat Wave Causes'\n\nFunny thing - I checked. Bob sells AC units. Dr. Phillips has 847 peer-reviewed papers. But hey, BALANCE! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nRemember my ocean acidity story? You made me quote that 'Institute for CO2 Benefits' (funded by ExxonMobil, but we couldn't say that - 'bias'). Their expert? A dentist. Against 8 oceanographers. But equal time!\n\nViewers now comment: 'Scientists can't even agree!' Mission accomplished?\n\nLook, I get it. Ad revenue down 31%. Can't offend the car dealerships. But when my kid asks why her textbook says one thing and our news says 'debate continues'... what do I tell her?\n\nP.S. - That 'Institute' sent a gift basket. There's a pattern here, boss.\n\nStill want me to find a 'vaccine skeptic' for tomorrow's measles outbreak story?",
