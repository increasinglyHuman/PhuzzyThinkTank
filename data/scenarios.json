Our analysis shows: 200 families within walking distance, 67% surveyed expressed interest, local schools want to participate. Similar gardens in Austin and Portland reduced neighborhood crime by 15% and increased property values 8%. Maintenance would require 20 volunteer hours weekly plus $5,000 annually. Concerns include parking loss (12 spaces) and potential noise. I recommend a 1-year pilot program with quarterly reviews.'",
