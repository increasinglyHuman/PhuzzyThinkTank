  "text": "Dr. Sarah Chen, a Harvard-trained biochemist, posted on LinkedIn: 'After 15 years researching aging, I'm excited about NAD+ supplements. Our study of 200 participants showed 23% improvement in cellular energy markers. However, results varied significantly - 30% saw no change. The supplements cost $80/month. While promising, we need larger studies. Also, exercise showed similar benefits in our control group. I take them personally, but can't make blanket recommendations yet.'",
