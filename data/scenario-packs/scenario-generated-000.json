While promising, we need larger studies. Also, exercise showed similar benefits in our control group. I take them personally, but can't make blanket recommendations yet.'",

Similar gardens in Austin and Portland reduced neighborhood crime by 15% and increased property values 8%. Maintenance would require 20 volunteer hours weekly plus $5,000 annually.
