# Pack-Based Audio Naming Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented pack-based audio folder naming to solve alignment issues between scenario packs and audio folders.

## Changes Made

### 1. Migration Script (`migrate-audio-folders.js`)
- Renames existing audio folders from `scenario-XXX` to `pack-XXX-scenario-YYY`
- Maps scenarios to their correct pack locations
- Creates migration log for tracking changes
- Handles unmapped scenarios gracefully

### 2. Voice Generator Updates (`tools/elevenlabs-voice-generator.js`)
- Modified to create folders with new naming: `pack-XXX-scenario-YYY`
- Takes pack number from filename (scenario-generated-XXX.json)
- Uses scenario index within pack (0-9) for folder suffix
- Backward compatible with legacy calls

### 3. Voice Player Updates (`js/audio/voice-player.js`)
- Updated `preloadScenario()` and `play()` methods to support pack-based paths
- Accepts optional `packId` parameter for explicit pack specification
- Falls back to calculated pack from scenario ID if not provided
- Maintains compatibility with existing code

### 4. Review Dashboard Updates (`scenario-review-dashboard-server.html`)
- Updated audio path calculation to use pack-based naming
- Includes fallback to old naming for backward compatibility
- Properly calculates scenario index within pack
- Gracefully handles both naming conventions

### 5. Core Game Engine
- No changes needed as audio isn't integrated yet
- Voice player is ready for integration when needed

## Usage

### To migrate existing audio folders:
```bash
node migrate-audio-folders.js
```

### To generate new audio with pack-based naming:
```bash
# Voice generator now automatically uses pack-based naming
node tools/elevenlabs-voice-generator.js --turbo
```

### In code when playing audio:
```javascript
// New way with explicit pack
voicePlayer.play(scenarioId, 'title', null, packId);

// Legacy way (will calculate pack automatically)
voicePlayer.play(scenarioId, 'title');
```

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates off-by-one errors** - Pack structure matches audio structure exactly
2. **Self-documenting** - Folder names clearly show which pack and scenario
3. **Flexible** - Can add scenarios to any pack without breaking numbering
4. **Backward compatible** - Falls back to old naming if needed

## Next Steps
When integrating audio into the main game:
1. Import VoicePlayer in the game engine or UI layer
2. Initialize voice player with game start
3. Call `voicePlayer.play()` with pack information from scenario manager
4. Use `voicePlayer.preloadScenario()` for better performance
