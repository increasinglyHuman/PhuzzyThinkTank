ORDER! *bangs Mjolnir replica* We convene to address the HERESY in Alien: Prometheus!\n\nFAN REP SARAH: They made the Space Jockey a SUIT?! A SUIT?! I have a $3,000 tattoo of the REAL biomechanical pilot! Now it's just... a tall bald guy?!\n\nKYLE: Sarah's pain is valid. I've prepared a 47-slide PowerPoint on why this violates established xenomorph evolutionary biology.\n\n*Shows slide 1 of 47*\n\nFAN REP MARCUS: I've started a petition. We've got 12,000 signatures demanding they declare Prometheus non-canon. My lawyer cousin says we might have grounds for emotional damages.\n\nSARAH: I haven't slept since 2012! Every time I close my eyes, I see bald engineers instead of proper elephantine pilots!\n\nFAN REP DEREK: What if we collectively agree it was all a dream? Like Dallas in the shower?\n\nKYLE: Derek, this is SERIOUS! They MURDERED thirty years of expanded universe lore! My 500-page fanfiction is now MEANINGLESS!\n\nNEW FAN EMMA: Um, I actually liked how it expanded the mythology—\n\n*Record scratch*\n*Everyone turns*\n\nKYLE: Security, escort Emma out. This is a SAFE SPACE for REAL FANS.\n\nMARCUS: I motion we fund our own movie. We'll call it 'Alien: The REAL Prequel.' I've already spent $40,000 on concept art.\n\nSARAH: *Crying* They made the space jockey... HUMAN-SIZED! *Collapses*\n\nKYLE: Meeting adjourned. Remember: Prometheus doesn't exist.

But here's what THEY don't tell you - plants are also WATCHING US.\n\nMy ficus has been tracking my bathroom breaks. I counted. 17 times it turned its leaves when I got up. That's not phototropism, that's SURVEILLANCE.\n\nWhich is why I'm proposing PlantNet™ - if they're going to spy, let's make it OFFICIAL:\n\n📊 Each plant gets a performance dashboard\n🎯 Oxygen output = Employee output\n💚 Wilting leaves = Written warnings\n🏆 Flowering = Promotion eligibility\n\nBut wait, there's MORE! I've discovered that different plants judge different skills:\n\n- Succulents: Time management (they survive neglect)\n- Ferns: Attention to detail (so needy!)\n- Snake plants: Leadership (they're literally called mother-in-law's tongue)\n- Cacti: Conflict resolution (approach carefully)\n\nJennifer from Accounting says I'm \"anthropomorphizing\" and \"having a breakdown\" but HER SPIDER PLANT HAS 47 BABIES. You know what that means? She's hoarding resources! Classic Jennifer.\n\nI've started interviewing my plants for 360 feedback:\n\nMe: \"How would you rate my leadership?\"\nPothos: *drops a leaf*\nMe: \"I DESERVE THAT FEEDBACK\"\n\nSome \"scientists\" claim plants don't have consciousness, but explain THIS:\n- My bamboo grows faster during performance review season\n- The peace lily ONLY blooms when I hit my KPIs\n- The office bonsai literally shaped itself into a dollar sign\n\nCoincidence? I THINK NOT.\n\nHR says this is \"not based in reality\" but they also said \"unlimited PTO\" meant unlimited, so who's the real liar here?\n\nI'm implementing a new policy: All meetings must include plant representation. They've been in every meeting anyway, silently judging our PowerPoints. Time to give them a VOICE.\n\nNext week: Chlorophyll drug testing (you can't hide your true nature from plants!)\n\n#PlantBasedManagement #PhotosynthesisProductivity #GreenCollarWorkers #NatureKnowsBest\n\nP.S. The rubber plant in Conference Room B asked me to tell you all it's disappointed in Q3 results. Don't shoot the messenger!",
