Are we curing addiction or creating new dependencies? The irony isn't lost on me. Yet watching alcoholics practice refusing drinks in virtual bars, seeing their brain scans normalize... it works. My son asks why I spent $50K on equipment instead of his college fund. Because 1,400 people are sober today. But Patient_47 built a virtual family to replace the real one she lost to drinking. She's sober but won't leave VR. Success or failure? I honestly don't know anymore. Published results at MedVR.edu/ethics. We're playing god with reality itself.",
