Our study of 200 participants showed 23% improvement in cellular energy markers. However, results varied significantly - 30% saw no change. The supplements cost $80/month. While promising, we need larger studies. Also, exercise showed similar benefits in our control group. I take them personally, but can't make blanket recommendations yet.'",
