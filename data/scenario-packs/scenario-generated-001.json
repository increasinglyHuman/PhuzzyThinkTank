      "text": "My neighbor Janet (retired nurse) swears the new smart meters are making us sick. 'Ever since installation, I've had headaches,' she told our HOA meeting. Dr. Richards from the utility company says they're safe - same RF levels as baby monitors. But I found a study from Switzerland showing 1.5x higher sleep disturbances near smart meters (n=394, p<0.05). Then again, the World Health Organization says no established health risks. Janet's selling EMF shields for $89 - says it's not about money, just helping neighbors. Our property values might drop if buyers think we're a 'sick building.' The utility offers opt-out for $15/month, but that marks you as a troublemaker. Three families already moved. Correlation or causation? All I know is my daughter's anxiety started right after installation. We need to ACT NOW before more families suffer! Sign the petition at StopSmartMetersNOW.org (Janet's son made the site).",

      "text": "Economics professor here. After teaching monetary theory for 20 years, I've discovered something HUGE about cryptocurrency. Yes, Bitcoin crashed 68% in 2022 (fact). But here's what mainstream media WON'T tell you: institutional adoption increased 340% during the same period (Bloomberg data). My former student, now at Goldman Sachs, confirms major banks are quietly accumulating. Of course, volatility is real - I lost $30k last year. But zoom out: every 4-year cycle shows exponential growth. MIT researchers predict $500k by 2030, though skeptics say it's worthless. I'm not selling anything - just sharing knowledge. Though if you're interested, my course 'Crypto Mastery for Professionals' launches next week ($497, but free preview available). Warren Buffett calls it 'rat poison,' yet his company holds $1B in crypto-exposed stocks. Curious, right? Traditional finance is TERRIFIED you'll learn this. Time to choose: stay poor with savings accounts earning 0.01%, or join the revolution? Register at ProfCryptoWealth.edu before banks shut us down!",

Yes, AAP says 2hrs/day is 'acceptable,' but that's funded by Big Tech. I tried everything: timers (he smashed them), parental controls (hacked in minutes), even therapy ($200/session, useless). Then discovered BrainBalance Method™. Not cheap ($97/month) but combines ancient wisdom with neuroscience. My son now reads for FUN! Still allows educational apps 30min/day - I'm not extreme.
