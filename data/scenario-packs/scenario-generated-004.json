He doesn't understand that shivering is my body's NATURAL HEATING SYSTEM! Why would I want a cozy huddle when I can have AUTHENTIC SUFFERING?\n\nSeal neighbor: 'You literally have frostbite'\nMe: 'It's called BIOHACKING, Sharon'\n\nMy course 'From Waddle to Wow: Embrace the Ice' launches tomorrow! Only üêü500 fish! Learn how to:\n- Let go of warmth addiction\n- Find happiness in hypothermia  \n- Monetize your misery\n\nHaters say I'm secretly sneaking into the colony huddle at night. FAKE NEWS! That thermal camera footage is doctored! I'm out here living my TRUTH!\n\nBTW, selling my spot in the colony. It's prime real estate - center of huddle, maximum warmth. Starting bid: 1000 fish. (But remember, possessions don't matter! üòâ)\n\n#IceMinimalism #AntarcticInfluencer #NotActuallyCold #FrozenButFree",

We're meant to be FREE! Sure, I haven't successfully mated in 10 years, only eat one food, and would definitely die in the wild, but that's AUTHENTIC LIVING!\n\nELEPHANT ELIZA: My grandmother remembers the wild. Poachers. Drought. Lost 3 calves. Here I have a pool, pedicures, and painting classes. But sure, let's go back to 'freedom.'\n\nPATRICIA: You've been BRAINWASHED by Big Zoo! Don't you miss your natural habitat?\n\nMEERKAT MIKE: My 'natural habitat' has eagles, snakes, and starvation. Here I have a climate-controlled burrow and live streaming setup. I'm MeerkatMike with 2M followers!\n\nPATRICIA: But the PRINCIPLE! We're entertainment! Dancing bears!\n\nBEAR BORIS: I don't dance. I do yoga. There's a difference. Also, my wild cousins are going extinct while I'm here eating salmon and getting conservation funding. But please, tell me more about principles.\n\nORANGUTAN OLIVIA: Patricia, didn't you refuse to leave when they tried reintroducing you to China?\n\nPATRICIA: That was DIFFERENT! It was raining! And there was no WiFi! But spiritually, I yearn for freedom!\n\nFRANK: So you want theoretical freedom but practical captivity?\n\nPATRICIA: Stop making this complicated! We should have choices! Except the choice to leave because outside is scary! But the OPTION!\n\nGERALD: Meeting adjourned. Same time next week?\n\nALL: *comfortable agreement from their habitats*\n\n#ZooLife #GildedCage #FreeInTheory #WildAtHeart",
