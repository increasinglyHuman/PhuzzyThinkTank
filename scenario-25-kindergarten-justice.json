Tyler said 'Move it, slowpoke!' That's VERBAL ASSAULT!\n\nTYLER: I said 'Excuse me!'\n\nSOPHIA: Same thing! You used your outside voice!\n\nJUDGE EMMA: Tyler, you're guilty of:\n- Line cutting (first degree)\n- Friendship privilege abuse\n- Outside voice inside the line\n- Making Lily cry (she's not crying but she COULD)\n\nSENTENCE: No playground for INFINITY MINUTES!\n\nTYLER: That's not fair!
