      "text": "Parent here - just left our PTA emergency meeting about AI tutors. Principal Chen showed impressive stats: kids using AI assistants improved test scores 42% (MIT study, n=1,200). But then she mentioned 'some teachers feel threatened.' Actually, 73% of educators surveyed report AI undermines human connection (NEA data). Of course, the $89/month AI tutor costs less than human tutoring ($200+/hour)! My daughter LOVES her AI helper - it never gets frustrated, explains concepts perfectly. Though yesterday she said 'Why do I need Ms. Johnson when ChatBot explains better?' That hurt. Finland banned AI tutors completely; Singapore mandates them. Studies conflict: Harvard says AI improves learning; Stanford warns of 'empathy deficits.' The company offering our school's AI system? Former Google execs who 'care about education' (and their $2.3B valuation ðŸ˜‰). I'm torn - want the best education but not robot teachers. Join our petition at SaveHumanTeachers.org or embrace the future at AITutorNow.com (both sites run by concerned parents, totally grassroots).",
