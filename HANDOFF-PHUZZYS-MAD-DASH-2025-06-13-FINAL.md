# Phuzzy's Mad Dash - Game Status Handoff
## Date: June 13, 2025

### Current State: PLAYABLE RACING GAME ✅

## Overview
Phuzzy's Mad Dash has evolved from a physics test into a fully playable racing game with:
- Functioning player controls
- Balanced NPC AI opponents
- Collision physics with obstacles
- Complete race mechanics (start gate, finish line, results)
- Strategic gameplay (careful vs frenzy clicking)

## Major Accomplishments Today

### 1. Fixed Critical Gameplay Issues
- ✅ Player ball now responds to clicks properly
- ✅ Balls follow the visual track correctly (no more "falling off")
- ✅ Camera follows player smoothly
- ✅ Collision detection works accurately
- ✅ Fixed flame swinger collision detection bug

### 2. Balanced NPC AI
Final balanced settings that create competitive races:
```javascript
// Click timing
clickRate: 0.8 + Math.random() * 0.3      // 0.8x-1.1x speed
baseInterval: 350 + Math.random() * 100    // 350-450ms intervals

// Accuracy
baseAccuracy: 0.50 + Math.random() * 0.15  // 50-65% accuracy

// Other parameters
Push force: 85% of player's
Panic chance: 3% (drops accuracy to 40%)
Hesitation: 1% chance every 5 seconds
```

### 3. Game Features Working
- **Start sequence**: 3-2-1-GO countdown with gate animation
- **Obstacles**: Chompers (stompers) and flame swingers with collision physics
- **Dizzy mechanic**: 2.5 second stun on collision
- **Bounce physics**: Realistic bouncing off obstacles
- **Race results**: Shows finishing positions, times, clicks, and accuracy
- **Two viable strategies**: 
  - Careful timing (avoid obstacles)
  - Frenzy clicking (power through obstacles)

## What Still Needs Work

### 1. Visual Assets Needed
- **Chompers**: Currently basic rectangles, need animated sprites
- **Flame Swingers**: Basic gradient circles, need proper fire effects
- **Start Gate**: Has red/white stripes but could use polish
- **Finish Line**: Needs checkered flag pattern

### 2. Integration Into Main Game
- Already has button in timeline interface
- Plan: Use iframe overlay approach
- Communication via postMessage:
  - Parent → iframe: Start race, player name
  - iframe → Parent: Race results, position, time
- Remove old draft from main game code

### 3. Future Enhancement: Difficulty Modes
Architecture is ready for:
- Easy Mode: Slower, less accurate NPCs
- Normal Mode: Current settings
- Hard Mode: Faster, more accurate NPCs  
- Pro Mode: Near-perfect NPCs
- Unlock system: Win 3 races to unlock next difficulty

## File Structure
- Main game file: `/test-physics-fixed.html`
- Working backup: `/test-physics-fixed-WORKING-20250613-183634.html`
- Location: `/.phuzzys-mad-dash-experiments/`

## Known Issues
- Flame swingers hit less frequently than chompers (fixed but needs testing)
- Some NPCs occasionally get stuck (rare with current settings)
- Visual debug info still enabled (collision zones, position percentages)

## Next Steps
1. Test flame swinger fix
2. Git commit and push current state
3. Create visual assets for obstacles
4. Implement iframe integration
5. Add difficulty mode selector

## Technical Notes
- Canvas size: 16000px wide (allows full track)
- Viewport: 800px (what player sees)
- Track data: Uses same spline data as main game
- Physics: Momentum-based with gravity simulation
- Collision: 0.2% distance threshold (32px at full width)

The game is now genuinely fun and competitive, with NPCs that provide a real challenge without being unfair!
