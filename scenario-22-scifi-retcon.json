  "text": "Emergency Fan Council Meeting - 'The Prometheus Incident' (Leaked Transcript):\n\nCHAIRMAN KYLE: Order! ORDER! *bangs Mjolnir replica* We convene to address the HERESY in Alien: Prometheus!\n\nFAN REP SARAH: They made the Space Jockey a SUIT?! A SUIT?! I have a $3,000 tattoo of the REAL biomechanical pilot! Now it's just... a tall bald guy?!\n\nKYLE: Sarah's pain is valid. I've prepared a 47-slide PowerPoint on why this violates established xenomorph evolutionary biology.\n\n*Shows slide 1 of 47*\n\nFAN REP MARCUS: I've started a petition. We've got 12,000 signatures demanding they declare Prometheus non-canon. My lawyer cousin says we might have grounds for emotional damages.\n\nSARAH: I haven't slept since 2012! Every time I close my eyes, I see bald engineers instead of proper elephantine pilots!\n\nFAN REP DEREK: What if we collectively agree it was all a dream? Like Dallas in the shower?\n\nKYLE: Derek, this is SERIOUS! They MURDERED thirty years of expanded universe lore! My 500-page fanfiction is now MEANINGLESS!\n\nNEW FAN EMMA: Um, I actually liked how it expanded the mythologyâ€”\n\n*Record scratch*\n*Everyone turns*\n\nKYLE: Security, escort Emma out. This is a SAFE SPACE for REAL FANS.\n\nMARCUS: I motion we fund our own movie. We'll call it 'Alien: The REAL Prequel.' I've already spent $40,000 on concept art.\n\nSARAH: *Crying* They made the space jockey... HUMAN-SIZED! *Collapses*\n\nKYLE: Meeting adjourned. Remember: Prometheus doesn't exist. We'll reconvene after therapy.\n\n#AlienGate #NotMySpaceJockey #RetconRebellion #CanonicalCrisis",
