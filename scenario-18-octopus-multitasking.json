PATHETIC!\n\nMy client Clownfish Carl said 'But Olivia, I only have fins...'\nI said 'EXCUSES! Grow more! I wasn't BORN with eight arms, I MANIFESTED them!'\n(I was literally born with eight arms but that's not the point)\n\nScientist Squid: 'Actually, each octopus arm has its own neural cluster, essentially mini-brains, which is why‚Äî'\nMe: 'NERD! While you're explaining, I just closed THREE deals!'\n\nMy new course 'OCTOPLICITY: 8X Your Productivity' launches tomorrow!\n- Module 1: Why bilateral symmetry is holding you back\n- Module 2: Ink-jetting through procrastination\n- Module 3: Camouflage your failures\n- Module 4: Regenerate limbs AND income streams!\n\nShark Sharon: 'I tried multitasking and crashed into a reef'\nMe: 'Should've bought my course! Reefs are just success obstacles!'\n\n*Three arms cramp simultaneously*\n*Drops laptop in ocean*\n*Accidentally injects self with own stress ink*\n\nSTILL TYPING WITH REMAINING ARMS!
