Today's rates:\n- 3 goldfish = 1 fruit snack\n- 2 fruit snacks = 1 string cheese\n- String cheese = PRICELESS (I'm hoarding them)\n\nTRADER LIAM: That's not fair! Yesterday it was 2 goldfish for 1 fruit snack!\n\nCHARLOTTE: INFLATION, Liam! Also, I control the goldfish supply. *Shows massive ziploc bag*\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER EMMA: Charlotte's mom packed her FIVE bags! She's created a MONOPOLY!\n\nCHARLOTTE: It's called SMART BUSINESS! Read my book: 'The Art of the Snack Deal' (crayons, 47 pages, mostly pictures)\n\nREBEL LEADER JAMES: We should start our own economy! Carrots will be our currency!\n\nCHARLOTTE: CARROTS?! *laughs maniacally* Nobody wants vegetables! I'll CRUSH your rebellion!\n\nUNION REP SOPHIA: The working class demands equal snack distribution! Why should Charlotte have all the cheese?!\n\nCHARLOTTE: Because I thought ahead! While you were playing blocks, I was studying SNACK MARKETS!\n\n*Black market forms by the reading corner*\nDEALER MASON: *whispers* Psst... got some underground apple slices...\n\nMS. JOHNSON: Snack time is for eating, not economicsâ€”\n\nCHARLOTTE: SILENCE! The market has spoken! *Raises fruit snack prices to 5 goldfish*\n\nTHE CRASH: Oliver eats his entire lunch, flooding market with pudding cups\n\nCHARLOTTE: *watching empire crumble* This is pudding manipulation! MARKET INTERFERENCE!\n\nEveryone switches to pudding currency. Charlotte left with 47 bags of goldfish nobody wants.\n\n#SnackStreetBets #GoldfishCrash #PuddingStandard #KindergartenCapitalism",
