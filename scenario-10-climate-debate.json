  "text": "Posted on r/UnpopularOpinion by u/SkepticalEngineer42:\n\nClimate activists want us to live in caves and eat bugs. There, I said it.\n\nEvery time someone questions ANY climate policy, we get labeled 'deniers.' But I'm NOT denying climate change - I'm questioning the SOLUTIONS.\n\nActivist: 'We need renewable energy'\nWhat they REALLY mean: 'Destroy all industry, return to stone age'\n\nActivist: 'Reduce meat consumption'\nWhat they REALLY mean: 'Force everyone to be vegan or starve'\n\nActivist: 'Carbon tax on corporations'\nWhat they REALLY mean: 'Communism with extra steps'\n\nMy environmental science professor (15 years ago) said climate predictions have been wrong before. The 1970s ice age scare? Population bomb? Acid rain was supposed to destroy everything by 1990!\n\nNOBODY is allowed to mention:\n- China builds a new coal plant every week\n- Electric car batteries are environmental disasters\n- Wind turbines kill birds (FACT)\n- Solar panels contain toxic materials\n\nBut sure, let's destroy Western civilization while China laughs at us. Let's make energy so expensive that only elites can afford heat. Let's eat synthetic meat made by the same corporations activists claim to hate.\n\nI CARE about the environment. I recycle. I drive a hybrid (by choice, not mandate!). But these extremists hijacked the movement. They don't want solutions - they want CONTROL.\n\nWatch the responses prove my point. Anyone disagreeing will call me a 'denier' instead of addressing my actual arguments. Because that's easier than admitting their 'green new deal' is just repackaged socialism.\n\nEDIT: Already being called a 'shill for big oil.' I drive a HYBRID. Reading comprehension, people!\n\n#ClimateRealism #NotADenier #ThinkForYourself",
