  "text": "Facebook group 'Natural Mamas Unite' (47K members) - Posted by Ashley Martinez:\n\nðŸŒ¿ PLEASE READ before attacking me! ðŸŒ¿\n\nMy pediatrician wants to give my 6-month-old EIGHT vaccines at once. EIGHT! That's more chemicals than in my entire kitchen!\n\nI did my research:\n- Measles deaths in 1900: thousands\n- Measles deaths in 2000: near zero\n- What changed? NUTRITION and SANITATION, not vaccines!\n\nDr. YouTube (yes I know ðŸ™„) showed a graph - disease rates were already dropping BEFORE vaccines. Pharma just took credit!\n\nMy grandma says: 'We all got chickenpox and survived! Made us stronger!' She's 89 and never had a flu shot. Meanwhile my vaccinated nephew has allergies, ADHD, and anxiety. Connection? ðŸ¤”\n\nNature gave us immune systems for a reason! Injecting aluminum, formaldehyde, and MONKEY KIDNEY CELLS (look it up!) can't be better than organic food and sunshine.\n\nAnyone saying 'trust the science' - remember when 'science' said smoking was healthy? DDT was safe? Thalidomide for morning sickness?\n\nI'm not anti-vaccine, I'm pro-CHOICE and pro-NATURAL IMMUNITY. If vaccines work, why are vaccinated kids scared of my healthy unvaxxed baby?\n\nBefore you call me ignorant - I have a Master's degree (in Marketing, but still!). I can read studies. And Big Pharma makes BILLIONS. Follow the money! ðŸ’°\n\nEDIT: Already getting hate DMs. This is why parents stay quiet! We're not crazy, we're CAREFUL. There's a difference.\n\n#NaturalImmunity #InformedConsent #MamaKnowsBest #DoYourResearch",
