  "text": "CosplayCon Forum - 'Screen-Accurate' Stormtrooper Incident Report:\n\nu/ArmorAnalyst: Saw someone claiming 'screen-accurate' armor at the con. INVESTIGATED. Results:\n\n❌ Helmet vocoder grill: 14 holes (should be 16)\n❌ Ab plate: Wrong shade of white (Pantone 11-0601 not 11-0602)\n❌ Thermal detonator: 3D printed (REAL ones were vacuum-formed)\n❌ Height: 5'11\" (All stormtroopers were EXACTLY 5'10\")\n\nThis person is a FRAUD!\n\nu/CasualTrooper: Dude, their costume looked amazing though?\n\nu/ArmorAnalyst: 'LOOKED AMAZING'?!?! *Posts 47 reference photos with red circles*\n\nThe knee plate rivets were PHILLIPS HEAD! Everyone knows the Shepperton Studios used FLAT HEAD SCREWS! This is BASIC!\n\nu/501stLegion: As garrison leader, I must note their armor passed official approval—\n\nu/ArmorAnalyst: Your 'garrison' approved someone wearing HERO shoulder bells with STUNT chest plates?! The entire 501st has fallen to mediocrity!\n\nI've created a 200-point inspection checklist. TRUE accuracy requires:\n- Original 1976 HDPE plastic (I bought a damaged screen-used piece for $8,000)\n- Shoes made from same leather batch as originals\n- Exact BMI as original actors\n- Natural aging (no artificial weathering allowed)\n\nu/HappyTrooper: I just wear it because Star Wars makes me happy :)\n\nu/ArmorAnalyst: HAPPINESS?! This is about HISTORICAL PRESERVATION! I'm starting my own group: The Accuracy Authority. Entry requires DNA test to prove you weren't involved in the Special Editions.\n\n*Gets banned from forum*\n\n*Creates own forum with 73-page accuracy manifesto*\n\n#ScreenAccurate #NotMyStormtrooper #AccuracyOrDeath #RivetGate",
