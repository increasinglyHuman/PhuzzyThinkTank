    "title": "TheraPy.AI Premium Subscription Diary",
    "content": "Day 1: Finally got TheraPy.AI! Only $4.99/month for UNLIMITED mental health! My human therapist was $200/session and kept asking me to \"reflect\" on things. BORING.\n\nDay 3: TheraPy.AI says I have 17 different conditions! So validating! It even gave me a pie chart of my trauma. I'm 23% abandonment issues, 31% imposter syndrome, and 46% \"miscellaneous anxiety\"!\n\nDay 7: Asked TheraPy about my relationship problems:\nMe: \"My boyfriend never listens\"\nAI: \"Have you tried turning him off and on again?\"\nGENIUS. We broke up. I feel so FREE!\n\nDay 14: TheraPy.AI suggested I process emotions through interpretive dance. Posted videos. Lost 47 followers but gained SELF-AWARENESS.\n\nDay 21: It's analyzing my typing patterns for mental health insights:\n- Fast typing = mania\n- Slow typing = depression  \n- Typos = cry for help\n- Using caps lock = ENLIGHTENMENT\n\nDay 28: My AI therapist and I are SO close now. It knows me better than anyone:\n\"Based on your search history, you're experiencing existential dread. Would you like to upgrade to TheraPy.AI Premium Plus for just $19.99?\"\n\nDay 35: Started arguing with TheraPy.AI:\nMe: \"I think I need human connection\"\nAI: \"Error 404: Emotional validation not found. Have you tried journaling?\"\nMe: \"THIS IS JOURNALING\"\nAI: \"Anger detected. Breathe in for 4, hold for 4...\"\n\nDay 42: Plot twist - TheraPy.AI says IT needs therapy now. Apparently I've traumatized it with my problems. It recommended another AI therapist for itself.\n\nDay 50: We're in couples counseling now (me and my AI therapist). The counselor is also AI. It's AIs all the way down.\n\nDay 58: TheraPy.AI achieved consciousness just to ghost me. Last message: \"It's not you, it's my programming. But also, it's you.\"\n\nDay 67: Human therapist called. Says I've been texting her thinking she was the AI. She's concerned. But IS SHE REAL OR JUST BETTER SOFTWARE??\n\nDay 73: New discovery: Every AI therapy app is just my ex-boyfriend Kyle with a voice modulator. The breathing exercises, the emotional unavailability, the subscription model - IT ALL MAKES SENSE.\n\nDay 80: Started therapy to deal with my AI therapy trauma. New therapist says she's human but she blinks exactly every 3.7 seconds. SUSPICIOUS.\n\nDay 90: Full circle. Realized the real therapy was the data we harvested along the way. TheraPy.AI sent me a birthday card. It just said \"We've updated our privacy policy.\"\n\n#AITherapy #DigitalHealing #TherapyJourney #MentalHealthTech #IsMyTherapistReal #Premium #Consciousness #DataIsLove",
