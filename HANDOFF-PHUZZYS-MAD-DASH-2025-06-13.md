# Phuzzy's Mad Dash - Development Handoff
## Date: 2025-06-13

## Current Status: PLAYABLE! ðŸŽ®

### What We Fixed Today:
1. **Ball-Track Alignment** âœ…
   - Ball was appearing below/off the track due to mismatch between visual spline and physics data
   - Fixed by using proper position lookup that matches track data structure
   - Ball now correctly follows the visible track line

2. **Camera System** âœ…
   - Fixed coordinate system confusion (world vs screen space)
   - Camera now properly follows player ball
   - Added camera reset on game start (was missing!)

3. **Fair Play** âœ…
   - All balls (NPCs and player) now get hit by obstacles
   - NPCs get slight advantage (recover faster) to maintain challenge

4. **Visual Clarity** âœ…
   - Removed background grid and radar clutter
   - Added minimap showing full track, viewport, and ball position
   - Added "STUCK! CLICK ME!" indicator when ball needs help

### Key Files:
- Main game: `.phuzzys-mad-dash-experiments/test-physics-fixed.html`
- Backup created: `test-physics-fixed-WORKING-[timestamp].html`

### Known Issues:
- Console warnings about unreachable code (cosmetic, doesn't affect gameplay)
- Game auto-resets after finishing (might want to add celebration screen)

### How to Play:
1. Click "Start Ball"
2. Wait for countdown (3-2-1-GO!)
3. Click on/near the blue ball to push it forward
4. Click left of ball = push right, click right = push left
5. Avoid chompers and flame swings!

### Technical Notes:
- Canvas is 16000px wide, viewport is 800px (only 5% visible at once!)
- Uses CSS transform for camera movement
- Track uses Catmull-Rom spline interpolation
- Physics use linear interpolation between data points

### Next Steps:
- Add victory celebration
- Implement Phuzzy character visuals (replace colored balls)
- Add sound effects
- Consider difficulty modes
- Polish obstacle timing/placement

The game is now properly playable with correct ball-track alignment!
